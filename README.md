What went wrong with the #AstraZion #TRC-20 token project - A comprehensive analysis  

(This investigative Documentation is developed and published for the community members of the AstraZion token who claimed to have been victimized by a "vicious scammer". AstraZion token came across the team during a preliminary research about the SCAMMERS OF THE WORLD's first cover story plan about 'the biggest lies in crypto world'. AstraZion flags the internet space so the team has to do a lot of digging until groups of AstraZion community members present themselves. This Documentation is participated by 273 AstraZion members.  
The investigating and research team is in possession of evidence of all claims that appear in this Documentation. The evidence are shown, navigated, and played to the investigating and research team through live social media platforms, websites, and the so-called "money-making machine" web and Android application provided by the "official" AstraZion groups or "gangs" to determine the authenticity of the exhibits.  

There are other 168 AstraZion community members who want their voice be heard and their accounts of the "massive fraud" be included in this Documentation. Due to the internal deadline of the investigating and research team it has been decided to include their accounts for the second cover story. SCAMMERS OF THE WORLD has a big interest in AstraZion because our investigating and research team is overwhelmed by fraudulent claims, misrepresentation, and pure evilness of its so-called Founder and Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and Team Leaders.)
